AI introduction ntpu 2019


Please use the following search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem.  
(a) Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS)  
(b) Uniform-Cost Search  
(c) Greedy Best-First Search  
(d) A* search  
(e) Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS)  
Input： A state of random layout of 1, 2, 3, …, 8, blank.  

goal state  

 1　 2　 3　    
 8　 *　 4  
 7　 6　 5
    
Output for each algorithm：  
(a) The number of movements (state changes) from the initial state to the goal state.  
(b) The maximum number of states ever saved in the memory during the process.
